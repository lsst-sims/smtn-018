Updates on how satellite mega constellations could impact observations of solar system objects and the overall fraction of pixels that could be lost to satellite streaks. Overall, we continue to find that planned satellite constellations would have a sub-percent impact on the number of pixels lost to streak masks and a sub-percent impact on solar system object detection.
